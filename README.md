AWS ALB Log Analyzer üìà

Overview
This project is a serverless log analyzer for AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) access logs. It automatically ingests log files as they are delivered to an S3 bucket, performs a detailed analysis, and generates a human-readable summary report.
The core of the application is a Python script deployed as an AWS Lambda function, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and maintenance-free solution for gaining insights into your web traffic.
 
Analysis Features
The analyzer generates a report covering four key areas, giving you a comprehensive view of your application's performance, health, and traffic patterns.
1. üöÄ Performance & Latency Monitoring
This analysis focuses on how fast your application is responding to user requests, using the unique timing fields available in ALB logs.
    ‚Ä¢	Average Target Response Time: Calculates the average target_processing_time across all requests to measure the real-world latency of your backend application.
    ‚Ä¢	Top 5 Slowest Endpoints: Identifies the specific API endpoints or pages with the highest average target_processing_time so you can focus optimization efforts where they are needed most.
    ‚Ä¢	Latency Bottleneck Analysis: Provides a breakdown of the average request_processing_time, target_processing_time, and response_processing_time to help determine if latency is caused by the client's network, your application, or the response delivery.
2. üö¶ Error & Availability Analysis
This section helps you distinguish between load balancer issues and application errors to quickly diagnose problems.
    ‚Ä¢	ELB vs. Target Error Breakdown: Compares the elb_status_code and target_status_code fields to differentiate between issues at the load balancer level (e.g., no healthy targets) and errors generated by your application.
    ‚Ä¢	Top Client Errors (4xx): Lists the most frequent URLs that resulted in a 4xx status code, helping you find broken links or bad API calls.
    ‚Ä¢	Top Server Errors (5xx): Lists the most frequent URLs that resulted in a 5xx status code, highlighting critical application failures.
3. üåê Traffic & Audience Insights
This part of the report gives you an overview of who is accessing your application and what they are requesting.
    ‚Ä¢	Requests by Target Group: Aggregates request counts by target_group_arn to show traffic distribution across your different microservices or application components.
    ‚Ä¢	Top 10 Visitors: Identifies the top 10 client IP addresses making the most requests.
    ‚Ä¢	Total Bandwidth Usage: Calculates the total data transfer by summing the sent_bytes field across all requests.
4. üîí Security & Compliance
This analysis provides insights into the security posture of your client connections and the actions being taken at the edge.
    ‚Ä¢	TLS Security Summary: Provides a count of requests by the ssl_protocol used, allowing you to monitor for legacy protocols.
    ‚Ä¢	Actions Executed Summary: Tallies the actions performed by the load balancer, such as waf, redirect, or authenticate, to audit how many requests are being processed by security rules.
